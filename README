2012 Wrap Up
http://redgarrett.com/wrap


This app will show you the top albums you've listened to this year that were released this year. 
Instead of just listing them in order of the play count this script figures out how much you've been listening to each album and ranks them accordingly. 

Currently still very much testing, breaking, fixing and retesting.
