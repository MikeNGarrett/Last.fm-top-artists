Welcome to the MusicBrainz XML service PHP class!

This project is a fork of https://github.com/olds/phpbrainz updating the
library to use the newer (v2) XML API provided by MusicBrainz
  (http://musicbrainz.org).

NOTE: This is a work in progress.

I've only implemented the Artist lookup so far. More good things to come :)


Original phpbrainz README:

This is an OO PHP 5 library for accessing the musicbrainz API. To search the
API, there are two different methods to access the musicbrainz API. One is a
search based on criteria such as artist name, track name, release year, etc.
The other is a retrieval of a specific musicbrainz record based on a specific
identifier for the musicbrainz database (MBID). Typically you search for
results using a release, track, or artist filter, then from those results
retrieve the specific record you want with the detailed information. There are
examples in the examples folder.
